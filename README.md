# Sudoku-Project
Simple Sudoku Code

This was my final project from my first coding class my freshman year at the University of Flordia. It is important to note that this project was a group assigment and I completed it with the help of three other students.
The goal of the assigment was to code Sudoku using pygame and other skills obtained throughout the year.
